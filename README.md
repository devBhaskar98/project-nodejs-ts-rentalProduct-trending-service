# Trending News CRUD API ðŸ˜Š

This is a Trending News CRUD API built with Node.js and TypeScript. It provides a robust backend solution for managing trending news articles,
utilizing PostgreSQL to store data in a dedicated table. This boilerplate project includes all the necessary setup, including CRUD operations,
routing, error handling for not found resources, and unit testing with Jest.

## Technologies Used

-   **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
-   **TypeScript**: Adds static types to JavaScript for improved code quality.
-   **Express**: Minimalist web framework for Node.js.
-   **Jest**: Testing framework for JavaScript.
-   **PostgreSQL** (if applicable): Object-relational database system.
